QordobaLib
=================
Qordobaâ€™s Java SDK offers platform-specific features that make the Qordoba implementation much simpler. The SDKs are open-source, and can be forked at the links below. Once forked, you can integrate our API into your application.

How To Configure:
=================
The controller classes accept the configuration parameters in their
respective constructors.

The code uses a java library namely UniRest. The reference to this
library is already added as a maven dependency in the  pom.xml
file. Therefore, you will need internet access to resolve this dependency.

How to build and install via Maven: 
=============

    1. Extract the zip file to a new folder named JavaSDK.
    2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the JavaSDK/QordobaLib folder.
    3. Execute "mvn install", this will install dependencies and also add the  JAR in your local maven repository. 
    4. In your own maven application, add the following lines which will refer to newly installed SDK: 
        <dependency>
            <groupId>QordobaLib</groupId>
            <artifactId>QordobaLib</artifactId>
            <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <scope>compile</scope>
        </dependency>


How to build via Eclipse: 
=============

For build process do the following:

    1. Open Eclipse and use "Import" option in "File" menu.
    2. Select "General -> Existing Projects into Workspace" option from the tree list.
    3. In "Select root directory", provide path to the unzipped archive for The code.
    4. Click "Finish" and ensure that "Project -> Build Automatically" option is enabled in the menu.

How To Use:
===========
Export the compiled classes as a java libray (jar). The exported jar can be used as library.
